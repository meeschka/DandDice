                <h3>Vaults</h3>
                <p>
                    After the player makes their wager, the house roles the first die, an eight-sided die (d8). 
                    This is the difficulty of the vault. If the house rolls a 1, the vault is a mimic and the player loses immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The player rolls two six-sided dice (2d6), trying to roll over the vault number.
                    If the player rolls double 1s or the vault number exactly, they activate the trapdoor, passing immediately to the second vault without winning anything from the second. 
                    If the player rolls a 9 or higher, they activate the trap and lose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Players who win a round of vaults move on to the next vault. Successive rounds are harder as the vault die is larger (progressing to 1d10, 1d12, and finally 1d20), but the payout is also larger.
                    The table below shows the payout on the original bet, and the trap numbers (if any).
                </p> 
                <p>
                    On the final vault, the player has the option of taking a crowbar.
                    This means they can add an additional four-sided die (1d4) to their roll, but the payout amount is reduced.
                </p> 
                <h3>Giants and Halflings</h3>
                <p>
                    Giants and halflings is a little like a single round of vaults where the number to beat is rolled on 1d10, and there is the option to split if the knee (vault number)
                    is met exactly or push if you roll two 1s. When splitting, the initial wager is doubled, and the player rolls one additional die for each die rolled originally.
